      "Apple School Manager is a new web app for IT staff and Administrators that helps schools deploy iPads and other Apple devices in schools and districts all over the world. I work with three other designers on this product. We together defined the structure of the app and its look and feel. I lead design of the volume Apps and Books store last year, and am leading the redesign of device management this year. Creating a product of this magnitude and complexity requires the cooperation of teams across Apple, which has made me a very strategic and flexible designer; one adept to ever changing schedules, priorities, and stakeholders.

      "LearnSprout creates analytics tools for educators. I designed two apps while working as the early-stage startup’s only UX designer. The first was an Early Warning System for help schools track collegiate preparedness and evaluate resource allocation. The second, a accompanying parent alert app, that would help students communicate to parents their student’s academic progress. This work challenged me to gain better technical understanding about the technology and data that we used to provide analysis. Both, so that I could design the best product possible, and so that we could bring data driven analysis and insights to non-technical customers in as sophisticated and accessible a way as possible.",

      "PERCH Displays transforms retail tables into interactive shopping experiences. When I arrived as a Design Intern at Potion Design, the principles had just created new, cheaper interactive table, one using projection technology. It was the first display of its kind at the studio, and they were hoping to find a market with retail stores looking for interactive merchandising technology. I worked with their first client, Kiehl\’s Since 1851 and under the direction of Jared Something, to brainstorm, design, and animate the first retail table. Though I was new the digital/interaction design, the technology at hand, and working in industry, this project taught me how to work in ambiguous circumstances, in this case a client with few expectations, and technological limits ill defined, and to experiment in order figure out what works and find a solution compelling to my clients.",

      "The Yale Daily News is an independent, student-run daily newspaper serving the Yale and New Haven communities. With a staff of about 90 per night, it publishes the main paper Monday through Friday, an Arts and Culture supplement every Friday, and a monthly magazine. It also maintains a website for all of its writing and news coverage. As a Design Editor on the Board of 2012, I lead design of WEEKEND, the arts and culture supplement, in print and online, and I collaborated with my co-editors to design the daily paper. We Design Editors focused on growing our desk, adding about 20 new recruits, providing training in editorial design and Adobe software, to prepare the board that would succeed us. This experience transformed me: I and my board members had to learn overnight how to do a job that we were not trained for; we were tasked with finding new and exciting ways to design the same product night after night, week after week; and we had to do this between the hours of 7PM and 3AM for a year. It was an education.",
