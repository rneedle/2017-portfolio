A product of this magnitude and cross-functionality requires a flexible and iterative process, and designers who strategically balance the changing schedules, priorities, and stakeholders. I lead design of the Apps and Books store last year, and am leading the redesign of device management this year. I collaborated with my team to define the visual guidelines of this product.",

These apps were among the first of their kind in the education sector and required a lot of research and prototyping in locals schools. LearnSprout was acquired by Apple, Inc. in 2015.",
